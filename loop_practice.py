# Create a list of groceries
groceries = ["hot wheels", "lego", "ice cream", "video games"]


# Do something for each thing in the list
# Eg.   *item
#        ---
#       *item
#        ---

# Print it out in a pretty way

for item in groceries:
    print(f"*{item}")
    print("  ---")


# Create a pyramid like this using a for loop.# Problem:
# Createa new years eve countdown
# Requirements:
# * Start off at 10
# * Countdown every second and print the second taht it's at 
# * Instead of reaching zero it says "Happy New Year"
# * Example output

stars = ["*", "**", "***", "****", "*****"]

for items in stars:
    print(f"{items}")
    print("---")
