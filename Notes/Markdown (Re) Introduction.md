# Headings
To create headings we use hash symbols (#) 
We can also create different "level" headings 
To create subheadings, we use multiple hashes

## This is subheading level 2

### This is subheading level 3

###### Level 6 is the smallest


# Modifying text style

# Bold and Italics

We can use asterisks (*) to modify text  style, specifically bold and italics
I want this  **word** to be bold
I wan this *word* to be italics
I want this ***word*** to be bold and it italics
***This whole sentence is emphasized*** 

## Aside: Escape Characters
If we want to place a character that is ALREADY a keyword or **reserved character we use the back slash (\)


# Strikethrough

We can strike through characters or words using the tilde (~)
eg. 
Mr. Ubial knows how to spell ~~neighbor~~ neighbour

~~This whole sentence is a mistake~~

# Links [example] ([Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/))
Links allow us to reference information externally
[a tool **YOU** might use](https://chat.openai.com)


Exercise:
Ask chatgpt to make 2 links to any website using markdown:
[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/)
I use [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) to do research
[Google]([https://google.com](https://google.com/)) *from chatgpt*
[Reddit]([https://reddit.com](https://reddit.com/))
[YouTube]([https://youtube.com](https://youtube.com/))
I use [keybr]([https://keybr.com](https://keybr.com/)) to practice typing.

# Block quotes

Block quotes allow us to emphasize a bigger chunk of text.
We use carets (>) to create block quotes.

eg. 
>This is an example of a block quote
>This is line two of block quote

>This is line four of the block quote; the third is blank


# Lists

We can create both *unorder* and *ordered* lists

# Unordered Lists
To create each point, We use asterisks (\**) wit ha space behind

eg.

* dairy
	* eggs
	* milk
	* cheese
* juice


## Ordered Lists
If there is a specific order tot the elements in our list,
we can create an ordered list
We use numbers, followed by periods to create ordered lists

eg. 

1. Put butter into mixing bowl
2. Add sugar to butter (*hold shift the enter to create a second line*)
   Both brown and granulated sugar should be added
3. Using the mixer, cream sugar and butter together



# Tables

We can organize information in tables using Markdown.
We use dashes (-) and pipes ()
Tables in Markdown require headings.
eg.

| Name.   | Age.  | Sign.   |
|---      | ---   | ---     |	
|Amelia.  |16.    | Aquarius|
