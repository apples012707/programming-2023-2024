|String or str.  |"hello world!"   | 
|Boolean or bool    | Tue False  |
|list |[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]    | 
|integer or int |1, -10, 1205  | 
|float |1.2 -432.21 1.0    | 


An example showing the use of these names:

favourite_food = "bibimbap"
my_age = 16
my_age_float = 16.0
# my_age_float is of type float
```
