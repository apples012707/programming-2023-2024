## Popularity and "Likes"

This type of paradigm makes a suggestion based on how many people "like" the thing.

One prime example of this, is the like button (heart) in Instagram.
When you click on that heart button, Instagram records it somewhere along with other data like demographics and psychographic information.
With this information, they might suggest to other users similar to you, products and services that you like.

We implemented the Popularity/Likes paradigm with our Favourite Bubble Tea activity.

## N-Point Rating System

N-Point rating systems are used by many services particularly Jeff Bezos' baby, Amazon.

This paradigm provided more granular information. Buyers are asked to rate the product on a 5-point scale
